# Practice: Dice Game
This game is based on rolling the dice and adding up the value of the rolled dice to current. If the rolled dice's value is 1, the current score will be reset to 0 and the turn will be passed on to other player. The player who has the turn can hold thus adding the current to the score and passes the turn to other player. First to reach 100 score wins.
